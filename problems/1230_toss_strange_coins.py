'''
You have some coins.  The i-th coin has a probability prob[i] of facing heads when tossed.

Return the probability that the number of coins facing heads equals target if you toss every coin exactly once.

 

Example 1:

Input: prob = [0.4], target = 1
Output: 0.40000
Example 2:

Input: prob = [0.5,0.5,0.5,0.5,0.5], target = 0
Output: 0.03125
 

Constraints:

1 <= prob.length <= 1000
0 <= prob[i] <= 1
0 <= target <= prob.length
Answers will be accepted as correct if they are within 10^-5 of the correct answer.

    def probabilityOfHeads(self, prob: List[float], target: int) -> float:
        n = len(prob)
        dp = [[0] * (target + 1) for _ in range(n + 1)]
        dp[0][0] = 1

        for i in range(1, n + 1):
            dp[i][0] = dp[i - 1][0] * (1 - prob[i - 1])
            for j in range(1, target + 1):
                if j > i:
                    break
                dp[i][j] = dp[i - 1][j - 1] * prob[i - 1] + dp[i - 1][j] * (1 - prob[i - 1])

        return dp[n][target]
